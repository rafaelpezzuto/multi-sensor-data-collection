## Additional Information
This MultiSensor Data Collection app, currently available for Android devices, is part of a larger project called SideSeeing.

The SideSeeing project aims to develop methods based on Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Urban Informatics applications. Its goal is to devise strategies for obtaining and analyzing data related to urban accessibility. The project is expected to consist of six modules:

- Collection and generation of multimodal datasets;
- Preprocessing;
- Labeling;
- Visualization;
- Application of artificial intelligence tasks; and
- Analysis of information for decision-making.

As part of the initial module, the MultiSensor Data Collection app is currently in the testing phase and is available for internal tests only. This app is capable of generating multimodal datasets using video cameras and sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers from mobile phones. Current efforts are focused on collecting data in regions of Brazil and the United States of America.
